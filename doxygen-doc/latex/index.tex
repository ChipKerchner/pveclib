library of useful vector functions for POWER. This library fills in the gap between the PowerPC vector intrinsic functions (as implemented by altivec.h) and major libraries like ESSL and MASSV. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Authors}

Higher level vector intrinsic operations are needed. For example the PowerISA provides population count and count leading zero operations on vectors of doubleword but not on the whole vector as a \_\-\_\-int128 value. Another example the ISA 2.07 provides vector multiply on even/odd unsigned int values but does not directly provide a full \_\-\_\-int128 by \_\-\_\-int128 multiply producing a 256-\/bit product. Also some useful operations can be constructed from existing PowerISA instructions and GCC Altivec Intrinsic built-\/ins but the implementation may not be obvious. And finally the optimum sequence will vary across the PowerISA levels as new instructions are added.

So the goal of this project to provide well crafted implementations of useful vector and large number operations.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Provide equivalent functions across versions of the PowerISA. For example the Vector Multiply-\/by-\/10 Unsigned Quadword operations introduced in PowerISA 3.0 (POWER9) can be implement in a few vector instructions on earlier PowerISA versions.
\item Provide equivalent functions across versions of the compiler. For example builtins provided in later versions of the compiler can be implemented as inline functions with inline asm in earlier compiler versions.
\item Provide higher order functions not provided directly by the PowerISA. For example vector SIMI implementation for ASCII \_\-\_\-isalpha, etc. Another example full \_\-\_\-int128 implementations of Count Leading Zeros, Population Count, and Multiply.
